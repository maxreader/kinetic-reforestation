kinetic-reforestation-pipette=Override tree with pipette selection
kinetic-reforestation-selected-tree=Currently selected tree
kinetic-reforestation-selection-mode=Biome aware selection mode
kinetic-reforestation-disable-particles=Disable particles for shotgun and grenade
kinetic-reforestation-disable-nuke-effects=Disable nuke visual effects
kinetic-reforestation-tree-disable-list=Tree disable list
kinetic-reforestation-use-last-tree=Use last tree if no options found

[mod-setting-description]
kinetic-reforestation-selection-mode=Heavy mode chooses the tree, if any, that would have been placed on the tile if map generation was forced to place a tree there. \n Light mode is fuzzier selection that allows trees to be placed in more areas than heavy mode, but is less consistent in which tree is selected.
kinetic-reforestation-tree-disable-list=Comma delimited list of tree prototype names to disable
kinetic-reforestation-use-last-tree=Sometimes there just isn't an available tree that "would" have been placed in a given location. In these scenarios, it's possible to fall back to the last selected tree.
